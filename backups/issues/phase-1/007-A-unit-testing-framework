# Issue 007-A: Unit Testing Framework

## Current Behavior
No unit testing infrastructure exists for validating individual functions.

## Intended Behavior
Create a bash-based unit testing framework that validates individual functions and provides clear test results and reporting.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design unit testing framework structure and conventions
2. Create unit testing functions with vimfolds:
   - run_unit_tests()
   - assert_equals()
   - assert_not_equals()
   - assert_file_exists()
   - assert_function_exists()
3. Implement test discovery and execution
4. Add test result reporting and formatting
5. Create test setup and teardown mechanisms
6. Implement test isolation and cleanup
7. Add test timing and performance measurement
8. Create test coverage tracking

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests can be written using simple conventions
- Test framework discovers and runs tests automatically
- Test results are clearly reported with pass/fail status
- Test setup and teardown work correctly
- Test isolation prevents interference between tests
- Test performance is measured and reported

## Priority
Medium-High - Foundation for all testing

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Dependencies
- Issue 001 (Basic Terminal Interface) for output formatting
