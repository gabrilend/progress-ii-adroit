# Issue 002-C: Save/Load Operations

## Current Behavior
No save/load functionality exists for managing game sessions.

## Intended Behavior
Implement core save and load operations that manage game state persistence across sessions with integrity checking and error recovery.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design save/load workflow and file naming conventions
2. Create save/load functions with vimfolds:
   - save_game_state()
   - load_game_state()
   - list_save_games()
   - delete_save_game()
3. Implement atomic save operations to prevent corruption
4. Add save file validation and integrity checking
5. Create save file metadata management
6. Implement incremental/differential saves for performance
7. Add save file compression and optimization
8. Create save file recovery and repair mechanisms
