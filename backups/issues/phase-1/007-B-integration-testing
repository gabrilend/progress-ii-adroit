# Issue 007-B: Integration Testing

## Current Behavior
No integration testing exists for validating system component interactions.

## Intended Behavior
Create integration tests that validate interactions between major system components including state management, git operations, and AI integration.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design integration test scenarios and workflows
2. Create integration testing functions with vimfolds:
   - run_integration_tests()
   - test_state_git_integration()
   - test_ai_command_pipeline()
   - test_save_load_cycle()
3. Implement state management integration tests
4. Add git operation integration tests
5. Create AI command pipeline tests
6. Implement configuration system integration tests
7. Add error handling integration tests
8. Create performance integration tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- Integration tests validate component interactions
- State management and git integration is tested
- AI command pipeline works end-to-end
- Save/load cycles preserve data integrity
- Configuration changes affect all relevant components
- Error handling works across component boundaries

## Priority
Medium-High - Critical for system reliability

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Dependencies
