# Issue 007-C: Performance Testing

## Current Behavior
No performance testing exists for validating system speed and resource usage.

## Intended Behavior
Create performance tests that measure and validate system performance, resource usage, and identify bottlenecks in game operations.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design performance test metrics and benchmarks
2. Create performance testing functions with vimfolds:
   - run_performance_tests()
   - measure_execution_time()
   - monitor_resource_usage()
   - benchmark_operations()
3. Implement save/load performance testing
4. Add git operation performance testing
5. Create AI command generation benchmarks
6. Implement memory usage monitoring
7. Add disk I/O performance testing
8. Create performance regression detection
