# Issue 004-C: Command Safety and Validation

## Current Behavior
No safety validation exists for AI-generated commands.

## Intended Behavior
Implement comprehensive safety validation and sandboxing for AI-generated bash commands to prevent system damage and ensure secure execution.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design command safety classification system
2. Create safety validation functions with vimfolds:
   - validate_command_safety()
   - check_command_whitelist()
   - create_sandbox_environment()
   - monitor_command_execution()
3. Implement command whitelist/blacklist system
4. Add resource usage limitations and monitoring
5. Create sandboxed execution environment
6. Implement file system access restrictions
7. Add network access controls and monitoring
8. Create security violation detection and response

## Acceptance Criteria
- All AI commands are validated before execution
- Dangerous commands are blocked or sandboxed
- Resource usage is monitored and limited
- File system access is restricted appropriately
- Network access is controlled and monitored
- Security violations are detected and handled

## Priority
High - Critical security requirement

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours
