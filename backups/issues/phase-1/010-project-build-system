# Issue 010: Project Build System

## Current Behavior
No build system or project structure exists. Code organization and deployment are not standardized.

## Intended Behavior
Create a comprehensive build system that organizes code, manages dependencies, provides development tools, and enables easy deployment.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design project structure following CLAUDE.md conventions
2. Create build utility functions with vimfolds:
   - build_project()
   - install_dependencies()
   - run_linting()
   - package_release()
3. Implement dependency management and validation
4. Create development environment setup scripts
5. Add code organization and module system
6. Implement linting and code quality checks
7. Create deployment and installation scripts
8. Add documentation generation tools
9. Implement version management and release preparation

## Related Documents
- CLAUDE.md (all scripts should work from any directory with DIR variable)
- docs/technical-architecture.md (Development Tools section)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All scripts work from any directory using DIR variable
- Dependencies are automatically managed and validated
- Code is properly organized in src/, libs/, assets/ directories
- Linting and quality checks run automatically
- Development environment can be set up easily
- Project can be packaged for distribution
- Documentation is generated from code and comments
- Version management works correctly

## Priority
Medium - Important for development workflow and code quality

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Dependencies
- Project structure created in earlier tasks
- Standard development tools (linting, documentation)

## Build Components
- **Environment Setup**: Dependency installation and validation
- **Code Organization**: Module system and import management
- **Quality Assurance**: Linting, testing, and validation
- **Documentation**: Automated generation from code
- **Deployment**: Packaging and installation scripts
