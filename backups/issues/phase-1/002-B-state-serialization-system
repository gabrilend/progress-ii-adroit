# Issue 002-B: State Serialization System

## Current Behavior
No serialization system exists for converting game state to/from persistent storage.

## Intended Behavior
Implement dual-format serialization system supporting both human-readable and binary formats for game state persistence.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design serialization format specifications
2. Create serialization functions with vimfolds:
   - serialize_state_human()
   - serialize_state_binary()
   - deserialize_state_human()
   - deserialize_state_binary()
3. Implement character data serialization
4. Add world state serialization
5. Create configuration serialization
6. Implement format validation and conversion
7. Add compression for binary format
8. Create serialization testing and validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Both human-readable and binary formats work correctly
- Character data serializes/deserializes without loss
- World state is preserved accurately
- Format conversion between types works
- Serialization performance is acceptable
- Data validation catches corruption

## Priority
High - Core persistence mechanism

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours
