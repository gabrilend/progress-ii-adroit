# Issue 001: Basic Terminal Interface

## Current Behavior
No game interface exists. The project is in initial setup phase with no executable components.

## Intended Behavior
Create a basic terminal-based game interface that displays a main menu, accepts user input, and provides basic navigation between game states.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create main game script with proper DIR variable handling as per CLAUDE.md
2. Implement basic terminal clearing and display functions using vimfolds
3. Create main menu with options: New Game, Load Game, Quit
4. Add input handling for menu navigation
5. Implement basic state management for menu transitions
6. Add error handling for invalid inputs
7. Create placeholder functions for game states (to be implemented in later issues)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Script runs from any directory using DIR variable
- Main menu displays correctly in terminal
- User can navigate menu options with keyboard input
- Invalid inputs are handled gracefully
- Menu can transition to placeholder game states
- Quit option terminates program cleanly

## Priority
High - Foundation requirement for all other functionality

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundational issue
