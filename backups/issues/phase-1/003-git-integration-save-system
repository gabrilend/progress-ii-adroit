# Issue 003: Git Integration Save System

## Current Behavior
No version control integration exists. Game cannot utilize git for save/load mechanics or time manipulation features.

## Intended Behavior
Integrate git as the core save/load mechanism, enabling "time rewind" gameplay through commit rollbacks and providing versioned state management.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Initialize git repository in game state directory
2. Create git operation functions with vimfolds:
   - create_save_commit()
   - rollback_to_commit()
   - list_save_commits()
   - get_commit_metadata()
3. Implement automatic commit creation on significant game events
4. Design commit message format (both human-readable and structured)
5. Add commit browsing and selection interface
6. Implement rollback confirmation and safety checks
7. Create repository maintenance functions (cleanup, compression)
8. Add error handling for git operation failures
9. Implement branch-based parallel timeline support

- docs/technical-architecture.md (Git as Time Manipulation section)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Git repository is automatically managed during gameplay
- Save commits are created on significant game events
- Players can browse and select previous save states
- Rollback functionality works reliably
- Commit messages are descriptive and useful
- Repository performance remains acceptable
- Git operations are transparent to the user
- Failed git operations don't crash the game

## Priority
High - Core gameplay mechanic

## Estimated Effort
5-7 hours

## Dependencies
- Issue 002 (File System State Management) - git will version the state files
- Basic git installation on target system
