# Issue 003-C: Rollback System

## Current Behavior
No rollback functionality exists for "time rewind" gameplay.

## Intended Behavior
Implement git-based rollback system that allows players to revert to previous game states, enabling the core "time manipulation" gameplay mechanic.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design rollback interface and user experience
2. Create rollback functions with vimfolds:
   - rollback_to_commit()
   - list_rollback_points()
   - preview_rollback_changes()
   - confirm_rollback_operation()
3. Implement commit browsing and selection interface
4. Add rollback preview and confirmation system
5. Create rollback safety checks and warnings
6. Implement branch-based parallel timeline support
7. Add rollback history and undo functionality
8. Create rollback performance optimization
