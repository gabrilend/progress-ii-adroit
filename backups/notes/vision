progress-ii is a terminal game that uses basic bash oneliners.
it's innovation is in the way the bash oneliners (notoriously difficult to
create and for bugs to reproduce) are generated by an AI quickly and efficiently
since it always knows exactly how to do whatever it is you want to do.

humans prioritize experience with urgency and relevance. computers are laterally
all one and the same. how could you forget that 2+2? it's inscribed there in
the training data.

therefore, computers are MUCH better suited to designing things like bash one-
-liners, because they know everything they can know about computers. meanwhile
humans gotta remember how to brushwash the sheep.

therefore, progress-ii is an experiment in utilizing the filesystem and it's
unique and visible storage capabilities while leveraging git within the computer
program (no user-control) as a versioning system that allows the system to roll
back. therefore, rewinding time is an intrinsic part of progress - often you'll
find that your explorative experience building just wasn't adding up, so you can
"respec" or "Adjust yyour timeframe" a little by rolling back git commits of the
state of the gameplay loop each frame.

luckily, since all this is written to hard disk ram, as long as they're using a
HDD drive and not an SSD (the main config file will request a HDD directory to
be manually defined, and will NOT accept any default values) then it shouldn't
be too much wear on the hardware.

just a little slow is all, which gives room to add unnecessary things like
saving a git commit every time anything changes.

"this tick the ball moved X units toward THIS vector"
"mana value was raised by 5 percentage on this unit, which is equivalent to 0.4"
"shield_enemy set to raise shield mode, timer since starting is 0.22 frames"
"last frame took 5 units of time so this frame is 37% done"
"input: B key, 0.08 units of time. input: mouse +x/-y, x=0.4 units y=11 units"

etc.

doesn't have to be in english, could be in a serialized data format that the
program could understand and rebuild itself. heck you don't even need git but
git is used for debugging and syncronization. so is english. okay let's build
both functionalities - serializable and english, and let the user choose if they
want faster runtime execution or more versatile logs.

the logs are more useful to an LLM who recognizes speech but does not recognize
data bits rotating.

anyway, here's a description of the game loop:

"speech is for humans"

in progress-II, you play as a hero character and her valorous heroic companions.
her name is Maxine, and she has many devoted followers.
the gameplay loop primarily involves choosing how to level up your characters
after watching them engage with the flow of the story.

there are several stats that you can level up, each time your character learns
something.

if you pick the stats that correspond to the events you experienced, you get a
bonus.

and each valorous companion gains 1 exp point per 5 the player receives - the
player, however, can only spend these points once 5 have been reached. This
unlocks the point pool, and the player can spend the experience points as they
please. Essentially, levelling up and choosing attribute bonuses.

other than that, there is little for the player to do but to watch and to plan.

throughout the game, there are decisions that your characters will make. these
decisions are based on their stats, and considering how the struggle in front of
them would best be unfolded.

this process uses hand-written events, and LLM generated descriptions of tasks
they have fulfilled. a hand-written event might be "the rope bridge looks
precarious, how do you cross?" and the AI response might be "I use my wit stat
to think of a clever solution" and the game is like "you're still on this side
of the ravine." and the AI response might be "I use my strength skill to lash
myself a raft" and the game is like "the water is distant and far: XYZ units"
and the AI response might be "I can scroll of teleport but I want to try wading
first - if the water is fast, I'll turn back. To test this hypothesis I will
hold my hand just in-front of me, and slowly advance through the shallows. I
hold my boots on my head." and the game is like "congrats you froze to death"
and the AI response is "my corpse will rot in a pool below a waterfall and all
the animals will be poisoned until a human comes along." and the game is like
"all the humans only spend time in their cities, they don't wander the land
anymore. if you want something done you gotta do it yourselves." and the player
is like "hmmm all our animals don't move things around, except for beavers and
dung beetles. I wonder if we could cross-breed them with a corpse-worm to make
a corpse-ball mover?" and the game is like "there are not enough corpses to form
into a ball." and the user is like "damn this is some hot cush"

players alternate between several states of being. the first is visiting the
market, where they may present their findings to the market audience. If people
like what they find, they'll take them from them and treat them to bounty in
kind. want a flask of venom? find a snake. want an apple pie? grab some wheat.

the players can request things by making a scene about how they don't have it.
"gosh I'm so thirsty, I wonder where's the next watering hole" (they call it a
pipe, these days)

and, if they're favored, it's possible that someone has the thing and it will
appear.

if not, that's cool too, she'll keep looking.
where else would you get things but from others?

================================================================================

next is adventuring, which is sort-of-a gateway activity. you can branch off
into several types of activities while just, hanging around, looking for stuff
to do. some people go on walks through the forest, others hang around downtown.
still others brave the vast sewers, large enough to handle a typhoon. but like,
they all know when a typhoon is coming, so they go above ground then.

other times you have a specific quest, which usually takes you to a specific
spot far away. then, you come back, ready to search for more quests to do.

sometimes, in times of peace, people build quest logs. just... writing down
information about the stuff they can do. always more quests to do...

then, in times of struggle, all they have to do is walk around and see what they
can improv do. [impromptu]

this struggle/peace variable oscillates like a sine curve over time. there are
many such variables, such as magic/drain, growth/death, fire/ice, nature/astral,
wind/stone, blood/temple, metal/wood, few/all, struggle/silence, etc.

these various variables vary the variety of a vailable versions of e vents.

thus, tailoring how the LLM enpeec's react. "you are approaching a ravine. it is
early winter. here are the status of the variables: [status-report.txt] (which,
by the way, will get saved locally to the hard drive in addition to be presented
there) it'll try to refer to trends and to current data. it's essentially a
newspaper for the denizens. the news, if you will."

================================================================================

another option available to adventurers who are undertaking the adventure action
is "dungeon exploration" - here's a ruined house, here's a damp sullen cave.
here's a burnt down grove, here's the lake of mystery. proceeding to location...
(dot dot dot)

inside of the house (for example) there are various challenges to see. "burnt
out lock" or "pile of cotton soaked by the rain" or "page titled damage-report"
or whatever else they happened to find.

there usually aren't wandering monsters. those tend to only happen on longer
quests. but... you can find quest hooks inside of scary places! where else would
you put your scary quest hooks? if it's a non-scary quest hook it goes by the
tavern door on the post-board they replace every summer.

another adventure option you can do is finding a rare ingredient. one that can't
be farmed, and which wanders far afar. like... river-lake gizzards, or flock of
singuidn hair. something something charlin hess stalks or foxglove-of-honey or
mighty purple beetle stegodon.

I can't believe you would be rude to pests. how could you? that spider was just
hanging on. now it's squished, thanks to you.

================================================================================

another option available to adventurers who are undertaking the adventure action
is "wait and focus on your skills" where they just sit around for a while doing
practice and testing out new ideas. sometimes they do research, sometimes they
try things out, it's really dependent on their characteristics. just the same
way that the dungeon exploration generates reactions to objects (and thus quests
) so too does rest-and-refocus offer skills and trouble challenges. this is when
wandering monsters are most likely to appear. because you're just sitting in one
place, so unless you're intentionally hidden basically everything's gonna
stumble upon you. also the skill and trouble challenges are a set of
circumstances and contexts which correspond to differently written notes.

to solve a puzzle, an adventurer must create a new solution to a puzzle of notes
if no solution may be reached, then the question must be wrong.

you can copy the notes from ~/notes/ once every time the program is run. the
local copy that was just copied may be edited, but the originals may not.

in the vast and distant future, it may become that preservation is holding us
back. that we should spread our wings and become untethered from our past.

this is a natural occurence, for none now live who remember the 1800s.

but, in a world where copying a file means expending a planet's worth of
resources, it just starts to make sense.

become untethered! start anew as one!

================================================================================

another option available to adventurers who are undertaking the research action
from the library building in town or at a site of magic lore and knowledge may
experience thought puzzles and thinking tricks. they must try to create their
own interpretation or solution, using all of their known tricks. this is a many
stage process, and few manage to solve an entire problem. they simply offer
their insight and guidance to a particular set of circumstances. then, ideally,
it is recorded as contributed, and future problems can reference it. so long as
reproducibility is present, aka no recording things that aren't true beyond you,
truth and accuricy should be maintained.

another option available to adventurers is to meditate or pray at a holy site.
this may be done in scenas of vast natural beauty, or at locations imbued with
rite and ritual. you know there's a reason this looks so unnatural, but you find
yourself nodding along to the magic. a story, told through museum dioramas, but
out and about in adventure.

another option available to adventurers is to go fishing. they can set out on a
boat, ideally one they just found on the shore, but sometimes you have to make
your own or struggle across land a little more. depends on the population (to
find a boat) and the vegetation (growth score of the province, to determine how
easily you can gather materials for construction).

in general, growth score gives more wooden goods and tools and weapons, while
production score gives more metal and leather and clay and trinkets.

production's opposite is primal, which determines how many animals are out and
about. more animals means more fierceness to the god of the land's creature DNA.

more fierceness, more hardened adventurers. Emphasis on MORE. >:D yay berserkers
yay fierce-fursona (fiercsona) but also TOUGHER and BETTER and CONFIDENT and
READY

this applies to any human denizens, or any other species appropriate. in
addition to the creatures and the general landscape all about.

another option available to adventurers is to go hiking. they can wander through
the woods and search for natural clues. this option is chosen if the character
has skill points in druid, which is the natural magic of knowing the [wood/land/
/home]. while hiking, they are given moments to appreciate natural splendor, and
based on the feelings evoked they can mage the land more magic. Beauty is magic,
while decay is drain. magic/drain are counterbalanced to determine the "Growth
Scale" of the magical and spiritual essences of that realm. when the adventurers
wander through the forest they can empower it with life - if they do, then fae
adventurers may appear and try to do what adventurers do. it's cute and they
love it, and the humans do too. 

meanwhile drain is dark essences, usually lonely and distant but with incredibly
deep characters and knowledge. they are the 2d projection of a brain layered on
impossibly many layers way off partway to the sun. (a very small part)

evil shadow lords and valiant dukes of the dark, they ride horses or motors and
swallow any who wander through the dark. if they like you, then you get to live.
if they don't, well you don't get to live here. bye here's the way through.

however, most glades are starlit, so have no fear about wandering along. just be
sure to stay where you can see home, or at least a place you know. any further
is testing fate, increasing your luck points but making yourself vulnerable for
more. luckily, luck points recharge on the regular, so you don't have to take
any risks for a bit of it to come back all the time. however, whenever events
turn your way, you spend luck points. like when a tree-monster is about to
devour you and you spend luck points to just get cursed instead. (automatic
action, you don't have to worry about it occuring it just happens to keep you
afloat, because a tree-monster knows better than to kill another permanently.)

curses include things like "automatically pees self" or "can't talk straight" or
"walks where no-one follows" or "can't poop on command" or "doesn't finish up
[progress/projects/proj-regrets]

sometimes, I feel most home at alone.

================================================================================

another action that adventurers can take while taking the adventuring action is
return home to marketplace. while at the marketplace, depending on the size of
the town adventurers may either barter by offering their goods and seeing what
gets brought to them, or they may buy a local currency, trade and exchange that,
then leave the stuff they couldn't spend behind. or take it afar to be melted
down for a fraction of it's value...

you should only gamble with things you are willing to lose. and I need my stuff.

while purchasing things, just like while adventuring is a stage where other
events may branch off upon, so too is purchasing goods. either with requests or
with currency purchase, depending on the type of town it is. these events take
place with the type of shop or alley. can also go to the park or royal gardens
or the sewers or the mage tower or the cafeteria. all the animal jobs and supply
are located out in a village arrayed in a circle around town. this extends many
further distances from the city itself, but still is mostly contiguous. you
sorta have to wander, because all the landmarks are locally placed. it's kinda
nice because you know you're never too far from safety and harm in equal regard.
such that you always have a 100% flee chance, even in the middle of the night.
(success rate of taking the escape action)
