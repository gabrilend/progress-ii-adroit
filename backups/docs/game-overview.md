# Progress-II Game Overview

## Core Concept
Progress-II is a terminal-based adventure game that leverages AI-generated bash one-liners for dynamic gameplay. The game combines traditional RPG mechanics with innovative file system and git-based versioning as core gameplay elements.

## Key Innovation
The game's primary innovation lies in its use of AI to generate bash one-liners that would traditionally be difficult for humans to create and debug. The AI knows exactly how to accomplish any given task through command line operations.

## Unique Features

### Time Manipulation via Git
- Git versioning is integrated directly into the gameplay loop
- Players can "rewind time" by rolling back git commits
- Each game state change is saved as a commit
- Allows for "respec" mechanics and timeline adjustment
- Supports both serialized data format and human-readable English logs

### Filesystem Integration
- Game state is stored and manipulated through the filesystem
- Requires HDD storage (not SSD) to minimize hardware wear
- Real-time saving of every game state change
- Uses git for debugging and synchronization

### Dual Logging System
- **Serialized Format**: Fast runtime execution, machine-readable
- **English Format**: LLM-compatible, human-readable for debugging
- Player can choose between performance and versatility

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Character System
- **Main Character**: Maxine, the hero
- **Companions**: Valorous followers who gain experience
- **Experience System**: 
  - Companions gain 1 XP per 5 player XP
  - Players unlock point pools at 5 XP intervals
  - Stat allocation based on recent experiences provides bonuses

### Game States

#### 1. Marketplace
- Barter system with goods and services
- Request items by expressing need
- Trade findings for bounty
- Currency-based or request-based transactions depending on town size

#### 2. Adventuring
Multiple sub-activities available:

**General Exploration**
- Forest walks, downtown exploration, sewer adventures
- Specific quest locations
- Quest log building during peaceful times

**Dungeon Exploration** 
- Ruined houses, caves, burnt groves, mysterious lakes
- Environmental challenges and puzzles
- Quest hooks found in dangerous locations

**Skill Development**
- Rest and practice mechanics
- Research challenges and skill puzzles
- Higher chance of wandering monster encounters

**Rare Ingredient Hunting**
- Non-farmable resources that wander
- Unique materials for crafting and trading

#### 3. Research Activities
- Library and magical site studies
- Thought puzzles requiring creative solutions
- Multi-stage problem solving with community contributions
- Reproducibility requirements for recorded knowledge

#### 4. Spiritual Activities
- Meditation at holy sites
- Prayer at locations of natural beauty
- Story experiences through environmental dioramas

#### 5. Outdoor Activities
- **Fishing**: Boat-based or constructed vessel adventures
- **Hiking**: Druid skill-based forest exploration
- Natural magic enhancement through beauty appreciation

## Environmental Variables
The game world operates on oscillating variables that affect available events:

- struggle/peace
- magic/drain  
- growth/death
- fire/ice
- nature/astral
- wind/stone
- blood/temple
- metal/wood
- few/all
- struggle/silence

These variables create dynamic event availability and tailor AI responses to current world state.

## Resource Systems

### Growth vs Production
- **Growth Score**: Determines availability of wooden goods, tools, weapons
- **Production Score**: Affects metal, leather, clay, trinkets availability
- **Primal Score**: (Production's opposite) Controls animal populations and fierceness

### Magic/Drain Balance
- **Magic**: Enhanced by beauty and natural splendor
- **Drain**: Dark essences with deep character knowledge
- Balance determines the "Growth Scale" of magical/spiritual essences
- Affects encounter types (fae creatures vs shadow entities)

### Luck Point System
- Automatically recharges over time
- Spent automatically during dangerous encounters
- Higher risk activities increase luck point gain
- Provides automatic protection (cursing instead of death)

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Built for terminal/command-line interface
- Utilizes bash one-liners generated by AI
- File system operations as core mechanics
- Git integration for state management
- Configurable logging formats (performance vs readability)
- HDD requirement for sustainable long-term play
