# Issue 008-C: Error Recovery System

## Current Behavior
No error recovery system exists for handling and recovering from system failures.

## Intended Behavior
Implement comprehensive error recovery system that detects failures, provides user notifications, and attempts automatic recovery with graceful degradation options.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design error recovery strategy and escalation paths
2. Create error recovery functions with vimfolds:
   - handle_system_error()
   - attempt_error_recovery()
   - notify_user_of_error()
   - initiate_graceful_degradation()
3. Implement automatic error detection and classification
4. Add recovery attempt mechanisms with multiple strategies
5. Create user notification and choice systems
6. Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
7. Add error logging and debugging information
8. Create recovery success tracking and learning
