# Issue 002-A: State Directory Structure

## Current Behavior
No directory structure exists for game state storage.

## Intended Behavior
Create and manage the directory structure for organizing all game state data in a logical, accessible hierarchy.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design directory layout following technical architecture
2. Create directory structure creation function with vimfolds:
   - create_state_directories()
   - validate_directory_structure()
3. Implement characters/ directory for player and companion data
4. Create world/ directory for environmental variables and locations
5. Add logs/ directory with subdirectories for different log types
6. Create saves/ directory for checkpoint management
7. Add backup/ directory for state recovery
8. Implement directory permissions and access controls

## Acceptance Criteria
- Directory structure is created automatically on first run
- All required subdirectories exist and are accessible
- Directory permissions are set correctly
- Structure can be validated and repaired if damaged
- Backup directory management works properly

## Priority
High - Foundation for all state management

## Estimated Effort
1-2 hours

## Dependencies
- None - foundational component
