# Issue 009: Phase 1 Integration Demo

## Current Behavior
Individual components exist separately without integration or demonstration of combined functionality.

## Intended Behavior
Create a comprehensive demonstration program that showcases all Phase 1 functionality working together, providing a foundation for Phase 2 development.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design demo script that exercises all Phase 1 features
2. Create demo functions with vimfolds:
   - demo_character_creation()
   - demo_state_management()
   - demo_git_operations()
   - demo_ai_commands()
3. Implement character creation and basic progression demo
4. Add state save/load demonstration with git commits
5. Create AI command generation showcase
6. Implement configuration management demonstration
7. Add error handling and recovery scenarios
8. Create performance and reliability testing
9. Implement user-friendly demo runner script

## Acceptance Criteria
- Demo showcases character creation and progression
- State management with git integration is demonstrated
- AI command generation works in practice
- Configuration system is shown working
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- Demo runs reliably and showcases key features
- Demo provides foundation for Phase 2 development
- Demo can be run with simple bash script

## Priority
Medium - Important for validation and progression to Phase 2

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Dependencies
- All other Phase 1 issues must be completed first
- Issues 001-008 provide the functionality to demonstrate

## Demo Scenarios
- **New Player Experience**: Character creation through first adventure
- **Save/Load Cycle**: Demonstrating git-based time manipulation
- **AI Integration**: Showing AI-generated solutions to problems
- **Configuration**: Customizing game settings and behavior
- **Error Recovery**: Handling failures gracefully
