# Issue 004: AI Bash Command Framework

## Current Behavior
No AI integration exists. Game cannot generate or execute AI-created bash commands.

## Intended Behavior
Create a framework for AI-generated bash command creation, validation, and execution that enables dynamic problem-solving and task automation within the game.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design AI integration interface (local model or API)
2. Create command generation functions with vimfolds:
   - generate_bash_command()
   - validate_command_safety()
   - execute_command_safely()
   - log_command_execution()
3. Implement command validation and safety checking
4. Create sandboxed execution environment
5. Add command history and learning system
6. Implement context-aware prompt generation
7. Design fallback mechanisms for AI failures
8. Add command result interpretation and feedback
9. Create configuration for AI model selection

- docs/technical-architecture.md (AI Integration Points section)

## Acceptance Criteria
- AI can generate contextually appropriate bash commands
- Commands are validated for safety before execution
- Sandboxed execution prevents system damage
- Command results are interpreted correctly
- AI failures are handled gracefully
- Command history provides learning opportunities
- Different AI models can be configured
- Performance is acceptable for gameplay

## Priority
High - Core innovation of the game

## Estimated Effort
6-8 hours

## Dependencies
- AI model access (local installation or API key)
- Issue 001 (Basic Terminal Interface) - for integration testing
- Basic security tools for command validation

## Security Considerations
- Command whitelist/blacklist implementation
- Resource usage limitations
- File system access restrictions
- Network access controls
