# Issue 004-A: AI Integration Interface

## Current Behavior
No AI integration exists for command generation.

## Intended Behavior
Create interface layer for AI model integration supporting multiple AI backends (local models, APIs) with configuration and failover capabilities.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design AI integration abstraction layer
2. Create AI interface functions with vimfolds:
   - initialize_ai_backend()
   - generate_ai_response()
   - configure_ai_model()
   - validate_ai_availability()
3. Implement support for multiple AI backends (OpenAI API, local models, etc.)
4. Add AI model configuration and selection
5. Create AI response parsing and validation
6. Implement AI failover and fallback mechanisms
7. Add AI performance monitoring and optimization
8. Create AI usage tracking and cost management

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple AI backends can be configured and used
- AI model selection is configurable
- AI failures are handled gracefully with fallbacks
- AI responses are validated and parsed correctly
- AI performance is monitored and optimized
- AI costs/usage are tracked and managed

## Priority
High - Foundation for AI features

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Dependencies
