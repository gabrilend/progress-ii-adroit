# Issue 005: Character Experience System

## Current Behavior
No character progression system exists. Players cannot level up characters or allocate experience points.

## Intended Behavior
Implement the character experience and leveling system for Maxine and her companions, including stat allocation, experience distribution, and bonus mechanics.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Define character data structure (stats, experience, levels)
2. Create character management functions with vimfolds:
   - gain_experience()
   - level_up_character()
   - allocate_stat_points()
   - calculate_stat_bonuses()
3. Implement experience distribution system (1 XP to companions per 5 player XP)
4. Create point pool unlocking mechanism (unlock at 5 XP intervals)
5. Add stat allocation interface and validation
6. Implement bonus system for stats matching recent experiences
7. Create companion management system
8. Add character display and status functions
9. Implement experience event logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- Experience is gained and distributed correctly
- Point pools unlock at proper intervals
- Stat allocation interface is functional
- Bonuses are applied for relevant stat choices

- Experience events are logged appropriately

## Priority
Medium-High - Core progression mechanic

## Estimated Effort
4-5 hours

- Environmental interaction (druid skills for hiking)
- Social interaction (marketplace bartering)
- Combat and survival (luck points, resilience)
