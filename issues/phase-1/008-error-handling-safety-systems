# Issue 008: Error Handling and Safety Systems

## Current Behavior
No error handling or safety systems exist. Failures could corrupt game state or cause system issues.

## Intended Behavior
Implement comprehensive error handling and safety systems that protect game state, prevent system damage, and provide graceful failure recovery.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design error handling strategy and conventions
2. Create error handling functions with vimfolds:
   - handle_error()
   - log_error()
   - recover_from_failure()
   - validate_system_safety()
3. Implement state corruption detection and recovery
4. Add file system operation safety checks
5. Create git operation error handling
6. Implement AI command execution safety
7. Add resource usage monitoring and limits
8. Create user notification and recovery options
9. Implement graceful degradation for component failures

- Issue 004 (AI Bash Command Framework) - safety requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- All file operations are protected against corruption
- Git errors don't break the game state
- AI command execution is safely sandboxed
- Resource usage is monitored and limited
- Users receive clear error messages and recovery options
- Game can recover from most failure scenarios
- Critical errors are logged for debugging
- System safety is maintained under all conditions

## Priority
High - Critical for system safety and reliability

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours

## Dependencies
- All other Phase 1 issues - error handling must cover their operations
- System monitoring utilities

## Safety Categories
- **State Protection**: Backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Resource Limits**: Memory, disk, CPU usage monitoring
- **Command Safety**: AI-generated command validation
- **File Safety**: Atomic operations and corruption detection
- **User Safety**: Clear warnings and confirmation dialogs
