# Issue 002: File System State Management

## Current Behavior
No state management system exists. Game cannot persist or load state data.

## Intended Behavior
Implement a file system-based state management system that stores all game data as files and directories, allowing for persistent game state across sessions.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design directory structure for game state storage (characters/, world/, logs/, saves/)
2. Create state management functions with vimfolds:
   - save_game_state()
   - load_game_state()
   - initialize_new_game()
   - validate_state_integrity()
3. Implement character data storage (Maxine and companions)
4. Create world state file management (environmental variables, locations)
5. Add configuration file handling (HDD path, logging mode)
6. Implement state serialization (both human-readable and binary formats)
7. Add error handling for corrupted or missing state files
8. Create backup and recovery mechanisms

- notes/vision (lines 14-42 about filesystem integration)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Game state persists between sessions
- Character data is correctly saved and loaded
- World state variables are maintained
- Configuration settings are preserved
- Both human-readable and serialized formats work
- State corruption is detected and handled
- Backup mechanisms prevent data loss

## Priority
High - Required for game persistence

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours
