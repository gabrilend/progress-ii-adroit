# Issue 004-B: Command Generation System

## Current Behavior
No command generation system exists for creating contextual bash commands.

## Intended Behavior
Implement AI-powered bash command generation that creates contextually appropriate commands based on game state and player needs.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design command generation prompts and templates
2. Create command generation functions with vimfolds:
   - generate_bash_command()
   - create_context_prompt()
   - parse_command_response()
   - validate_command_syntax()
3. Implement context-aware prompt generation
4. Add game state integration for command context
5. Create command suggestion and ranking system
6. Implement command history and learning
7. Add command optimization and efficiency checking
8. Create command explanation and documentation
