# Issue 007: Basic Testing Framework

## Current Behavior
No testing infrastructure exists. Code quality and functionality cannot be verified automatically.

## Intended Behavior
Create a basic testing framework that validates core functionality, state management, and system integration to ensure reliability during development.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design testing framework structure and conventions
2. Create testing utility functions with vimfolds:
   - run_test_suite()
   - assert_equals()
   - assert_file_exists()
   - assert_git_state()
3. Implement unit tests for core functions
4. Create integration tests for state management
5. Add git operation testing
6. Implement configuration validation tests
7. Create character system tests
8. Add performance and load testing
9. Implement automated test runner script

- docs/roadmap.md (Phase 1 success criteria)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Test suite can be run with a single command
- Unit tests cover all core functions
- Integration tests validate system interactions
- State management tests verify persistence
- Git operations are thoroughly tested
- Test results are clearly reported
- Tests can be run automatically during development
- Test framework is extensible for future phases

## Priority
Medium - Important for code quality and development confidence

## Estimated Effort
4-5 hours

## Dependencies
- All other Phase 1 issues - tests validate their functionality
- Basic shell testing utilities

## Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function validation
- **Integration Tests**: System component interaction
- **State Tests**: File system and git operations
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and resource usage
- **Error Handling Tests**: Failure scenarios and recovery
