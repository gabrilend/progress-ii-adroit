# Issue 008-B: Resource Monitoring System

## Current Behavior
No resource monitoring exists for tracking system usage and preventing resource exhaustion.

## Intended Behavior
Implement comprehensive resource monitoring that tracks CPU, memory, disk, and network usage with limits and alerts to prevent system overload.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design resource monitoring strategy and thresholds
2. Create resource monitoring functions with vimfolds:
   - monitor_system_resources()
   - check_resource_limits()
   - alert_resource_usage()
   - throttle_operations()
3. Implement CPU usage monitoring and limits
4. Add memory usage tracking and management
5. Create disk space monitoring and cleanup
6. Implement network usage monitoring (for AI APIs)
7. Add resource usage alerts and warnings
8. Create automatic resource management and throttling

## Acceptance Criteria
- System resources are monitored continuously
- Resource limits prevent system overload
- Alerts warn before resource exhaustion
- Automatic throttling manages resource usage
- Resource usage data is logged and tracked
- Resource monitoring operates efficiently

## Priority
High - Prevents system instability

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Dependencies
- System monitoring utilities (top, df, etc.)
