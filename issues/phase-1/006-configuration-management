# Issue 006: Configuration Management

## Current Behavior
No configuration system exists. Game cannot store user preferences or system settings.

## Intended Behavior
Create a comprehensive configuration management system that handles user preferences, system settings, and game options with validation and defaults.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design configuration file structure and format
2. Create configuration functions with vimfolds:
   - load_configuration()
   - save_configuration()
   - validate_config_values()
   - set_config_defaults()
3. Implement HDD path configuration and validation
4. Add logging mode selection (performance vs readability)
5. Create AI model configuration options
6. Implement game difficulty and mechanic customization
7. Add configuration validation and error handling
8. Create configuration reset and backup mechanisms
9. Implement runtime configuration updates

- docs/technical-architecture.md (Configuration System section)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Configuration file is created with sensible defaults
- HDD path is validated and enforced (no SSD acceptance)
- Logging mode can be switched between performance and readability
- AI model selection is configurable
- Configuration changes persist between sessions
- Invalid configuration values are rejected with helpful messages
- Configuration can be reset to defaults
- Runtime configuration updates work without restart

## Priority
Medium - Important for user experience and system requirements

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Dependencies
- Issue 002 (File System State Management) - for configuration persistence
- HDD detection utilities for path validation

## Configuration Categories
- **System Settings**: HDD path, logging mode, performance options
- **AI Settings**: Model selection, API keys, response timeouts
- **Game Settings**: Difficulty, auto-save frequency, display options
- **User Preferences**: Interface colors, sound settings, key bindings
