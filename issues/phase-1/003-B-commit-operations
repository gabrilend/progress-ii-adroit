# Issue 003-B: Commit Operations

## Current Behavior
No git commit functionality exists for creating save points.

## Intended Behavior
Implement git commit operations for creating versioned save points with descriptive messages and metadata.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design commit message format and metadata structure
2. Create commit operation functions with vimfolds:
   - create_save_commit()
   - generate_commit_message()
   - add_commit_metadata()
   - validate_commit_success()
3. Implement automatic staging of game state changes
4. Add structured commit message generation
5. Create commit metadata tracking (timestamp, game state, etc.)
6. Implement commit validation and error handling
7. Add commit message templates for different event types
8. Create commit performance optimization
