# Issue 008-A: State Protection System

## Current Behavior
No state protection exists against corruption or data loss.

## Intended Behavior
Implement comprehensive state protection including backup mechanisms, corruption detection, and automatic recovery to ensure game state integrity.

## Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Design state protection strategy and backup policies
2. Create state protection functions with vimfolds:
   - create_state_backup()
   - detect_state_corruption()
   - recover_from_corruption()
   - validate_state_integrity()
3. Implement automatic backup creation and rotation
4. Add state file corruption detection algorithms
5. Create automatic recovery mechanisms
6. Implement state integrity validation and checksums
7. Add backup verification and testing
8. Create state protection monitoring and alerts
